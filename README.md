# Turtle GUI Testing Program

This repository contains Python scripts used to test the Turtle GUI, exploring various shapes and creating a color palette for artistic purposes.

## Usage

To run the scripts locally:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/alecbideri/Turtle-GUI.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

3. Run the desired Python script:

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the Python script you want to execute.

## Shapes

The following shapes have been implemented in the scripts:

- Square
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Hexagon
- Octagon
- Decagon
- spirograph

## sample output for one of the shapes:

Each shape is drawn using the Turtle graphics library, demonstrating different features and techniques.

## Color Palette for Artistic Work

One of the scripts generates a color palette using multiple colors. This palette can be used for artistic purposes, such as creating colorful patterns or drawings.

## Sample outputs :
